# How to test the development version of MapSwipe

If you want to see the latest developments of the app, or to test a specific new feature, you can install the "development" version of the app.

It can be used side by side with the normal ("production") app, so it won't affect your normal MapSwiping :)

## 1 - Install the app

### Android

From your phone, head to [the MapSwipe releases page](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe/releases) on Github, and select the latest version ending in `-beta` (unless you've been asked to test a specific version). Expand the "Assets" dropdown just under it, and download the `app-dev-release.apk` onto your phone.

Android should automatically ask if you want to install this app. Just say ok, and you're all set.

In some cases, you might need to allow your phone to install apps from "untrusted sources". The details vary, but [this article](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-apps-from-unknown-sources-android/) should give you a good idea how to do it.

### iOS

If you have an iPhone, you first need to install an app called [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) from the AppStore. It's an official Apple app, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.

Once installed, email us at [info@mapswipe.org](mailto:info@mapswipe.org) to request an invitation link to the test programme. Make sure to include your Apple ID (it's an email address) in your request.


## 2 - Run the app

When you open the app, it will look exactly like the "normal" MapSwipe. This one runs on a separate server, so you will need to create an account on it first. You can use the same email/login as the normal app, or anything you want. This account will be completely separate from your "real" one, so your stats will be different, etc...

There is a variable number of projects available on the dev app, and you're welcome to try any of them. Just be aware that things may not be working as expected, or not at all.

Do not think too much about the quality of your work here because it all gets thrown away every now and then!

## 3 - Let us know

Please let us know how things went, as your feedback directly helps us improve the app and make sure bugs don't make it to the wider public.

The best way to report on your findings is on [our issue tracker](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe/issues). If this feels overwhelming, you can also email us at [info@mapswipe.org](mailto:info@mapswipe.org), but we might be slower at responding there.

Happy testing!
